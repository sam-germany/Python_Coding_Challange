Rotate the List by One ðŸ”„
Given a list, rotates the values clockwise by one (the last value is sent to the first position).

Check the examples for a better understanding.

Examples
rotate_by_one([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) âžž [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

rotate_by_one([6, 5, 8, 9, 7]) âžž [7, 6, 5, 8, 9]

rotate_by_one([20, 15, 26, 8, 4]) âžž [4, 20, 15, 26, 8]
Notes
All lists are the same size, so it's not necessary to use loops or to think much about complex solutions.

def rotate_by_one(lst):
    return [lst[-1]]+lst[0:-1]


rotate_by_one = lambda a:a[-1:] + a[:-1]
