I'd Like a New Shade of Blue, Please
I have a bucket containing an amount of navy blue paint and I'd like to paint as many walls as possible. Create a function that returns the number of complete walls that I can paint, before I need to head to the shops to buy more.

n is the number of square meters I can paint.
w and h are the widths and heights of a single wall in meters.
Examples
how_many_walls(100, 4, 5) ➞ 5

how_many_walls(10, 15, 12) ➞ 0

how_many_walls(41, 3, 6) ➞ 2
Notes
Don't count a wall if I don't manage to finish painting all of it before I run out of paint.
All walls will have the same dimensions.
All numbers will be positive integers.
"""
def how_many_walls(n, w, h):
    return n//(w*h)


def how_many_walls(n, w, h):
    return int(n/(w*h))
