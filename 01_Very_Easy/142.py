Keyboard Mistakes
Character recognition software often makes mistakes when documents (especially old ones written with a typewriter) are digitized.

Your task is to correct the errors in the digitized text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

A is misinterpreted as 4
S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

Examples
keyboard_mistakes("MUB45H1R") ➞ "MUBASHIR"

keyboard_mistakes("DUBL1N") ➞ "DUBLIN"

keyboard_mistakes("51NG4P0RE") ➞ "SINGAPORE"
Notes
N/A
