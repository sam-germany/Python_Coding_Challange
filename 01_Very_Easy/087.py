"""
Destructuring Assignment (Ignoring Values)
You can assign variables from lists like this:

first, _ , last = [1, 2, 8]

first   = lst[0]

_   = ignores second value (2)

last   = lst[-1]

print(first) ➞ outputs 1
print(last) ➞ outputs 8
Using Destructuring Assignment (check the Resources tab), your task is to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, first, a variable to ignore all middle values and last.

Notes
Your solution should be just One Line code.
If your solution is longer than one line of code, please check the Resources tab.
