"""
Slightly Superior
You will be given two extremely similar lists, but exactly one of the items in a list will be valued slightly higher than its counterpart (which means that evaluating the value > the other value will return True).

Create a function that returns whether the first list is slightly superior to the second list.

Examples
is_first_superior([1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3]) ➞ True
# The pair of items at each index are compared in turn.
# 1 from the first list is the same as 1 from the second list.
# 2 is the same as 2.
# However, 4 is greater than 3, so list one is superior.

is_first_superior(["a", "d", "c"], ["a", "b", "c"]) ➞ True

is_first_superior(["zebra", "ostrich", "whale"], ["ant", "ostrich", "whale"]) ➞ True

is_first_superior([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4, 4]) ➞ False

is_first_superior([True, 10, "zebra"], [True, 10, "zebra"]) ➞ False
Notes
Both lists will be the same length.
All values and their counterparts will always be the same data type.
The lists will only be different by one element.
If the two lists are the same, return False.
