Raucous Applause
After an amazing performance, the crowd goes wild! People clap enthusiastically and most claps overlap with each other to create one homogeneous sound.

An overlapped clap is a clap which starts but doesn't finish, as in "ClaClap" (the first clap is cut short and there are overall 2 claps).

Given a string of what the overlapping claps sounded like, return how many claps were made in total.

Examples
count_claps("ClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 4

count_claps("ClClClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 6

count_claps("CCClaClClap!Clap!ClClClap!") ➞ 9
Notes
Each clap starts with a capital "C".
