"""
Destructuring Lists III
You can assign variables from lists with destructuring like this:

arr = ["eyes", "nose", "lips", "ears"]
eyes, nose, lips, ears = arr
If you don't need every list index stored in a named variable, you can use _ as a throwaway variable.

arr = ["eyes", "nose", "lips", "ears"]
_ , nose, _, _ = arr
... this assigns the value in arr[1] to the variable nose. The values in each other index will be assigned to the variable _ in order, overwriting each previous value. nose now holds the string "nose", and _ now holds the string "ears".

Use destructuring assignment on the given list to assign the string "lips" to the variable provided. Do not use list indexing, or assigning variable names to any of the other strings.

Notes
Check the Resources tab for more examples.
