Iterable Unpacking
There is an easy way to assign to array values to the nth index by using the Rest element.

head, tail = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(head) ➞ 1
print(tail) ➞ 2
But how could I make tail = [2, 3, 4] instead of tail = 2? Add something into the code and make this happen.

Notes
Check the Resources tab for more examples.
