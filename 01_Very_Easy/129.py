Recreating the abs() Function
The abs() function returns the absolute value of a number. This means it returns a number's positive value. You can think of it as the distance away from zero.

Create a function that recreates this functionality.

Examples
absolute(-5) ➞ 5

absolute(-3.14) ➞ 3.14

absolute(250) ➞ 250
Notes
Tests will only include valid numbers.
Note that positive numbers will stay positive!
Don't use the abs() function (it will defeat the purpose of the challenge).
